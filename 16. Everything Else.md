## Everything Else

### Amazon LEX

> tldr; **Speech to text**

Lex for Voice or Lex for Alexa

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

Powers the Alexa service

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) - Intent

Build understanding into your application

Scales, Integrates, Quick to deploy, PAYG pricing

Services: 

- Chatbots

- Voice Assistants

- Q&A Bots

- Info/Enterprise Bots

Lex provides Bots - things that can converse in 1+ languages

Concepts of Intents and Utterances

- Utterance is a way an intent is expressed
- e.g. Can I order, I want to order, give me a

Fulfil intent -> Lambda interaction (Lambda great in event driven architecture)

Slot: a required piece of info that goes along with an intent, e.g. small pizza, normal crust

### Amazon Connect

> tldr; **Contact Center... as a service**

Cloud version of a call center

Omnichannel - Voice & Chat, Incoming and Outgoing calls

Integates with PSTN networks for traditional voice

Agents can connect to connect from anywhere - internet based

Integrates with AWS services (Lambda/LEX) for additional intelligence and features

Quick to provision, PAYG pricing, highly scalable

### Combining LEX and Connect

Bob -> Calls number -> Hits Amazon Connect -> Speech to Text -> Determine Intent

### Kinesis Video Streams

> tldr; **Ingest live video data from producers**

e.g. Security cameras, cars, drones, audio, thermal, depth RADAR data

Consumers can access data frame-by-frame or as needed

Can persist and encrypt (in-transit and at rest)

Exam: Can't access media directly - have to go via APIs

Integrates with other AWS services, e.g. Rekognition (deep learning on video) and Connect

Scenario: Home security camera, face recognition

Scenario: Kinesis Video Stream -> Rekognition Video -> Check Face Collection -> Kinesis datastream (analysis of video) -> Lambda Analysis of every flagged record -> SNS

Exam: Live video streaming + Analytics + G Streamer + RTSP = default answer Kinesis Video Streams

### AWS Glue

> tldr; **Serverless** **ETL system (Extract, Transform & Load)**

Uses EMR clusters to do the tasks

Moves data and transforms it between source and destination

Crawls data sources

Generates AWS Glue Data catalog

Data sources: S3, RDS, JDBC compatible, DynamoDB

Data Source Streams: Kinesis Data Stream, Apache Kafka

Data Targets: S3, RDS, JDBC Databases

Data Catalog: A collection of metadata combined with data management and search tools -- persistent metadata about data sources in region

One catalog per region per account

Avoids data silos 

How is data discovered? We set up crawlers.

The Glue crawler connects, determines schemas, creates metadata, puts it in catalog

Now we have visibility across the org

A Glue Job can extract data and load it into a different target, via a script that can change stuff in processing

Glue Job can be initiated manually or via events using EventBridge

Compared to Data Pipelines -- historically used for ETL

If you see both look for keywords -- use glue if you see these:

- Ad-hoc
- Serverless
- Cost effective

### AWS Device Farm

> tldr; **Managed Web and Mobile application testing**, they supply all the devices so you don't have to

Test on a fleet of real browsers and devices

- These are things like phones, tables, different languages, sizes, operating systems

Use built-in or supported automated testing frameworks

Receive reports detailing testing outputs

Supports remote connection to devices

Application Binary -> Device Farm: Run -> (Analysis of supported devices) -> Configure which devices should run the tests -> Detailed test results, logs and other outputs

Can configure device state, additional apps, radio states, devices location, device language

### Amazon Comprehend

> tldr; **Natural language processing (NLP) service.** You provide a document, it develops insights

Input = Document (text)

Output = Entities, phrases, language, PII, sentiments

Can use either pre-trained models or Custom

Real-time analysis for small workloads, async for large workloads

Detects entities with a confidence level between 0 and 1 e.g. 0.99 sure John

Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, mixed)

### Amazon Kendra

> tldr; **Intelligent search service**

Designed to mimic interacting with a human expert

Supports a range of question types:

- Factoid: Who, What, Where
- Descriptive: How do I get my cat to stop being a jerk?
- Keyword: What time is the keynote address? (address can have multiple meanings - Kendra helps determine intent)

Kendra adds value by handling the difficult analysis

Index: Searchable data

Data Source: Where your data lives 

- S3, Confluence, Google Workspace, Rds, OneDrive, Salesforce, Kendra Web Crawler, Workdocs, FSx etc

Syncronises Data Source and Index on a schedule

Integrates with AWS Services (IAM, Identity Centre (SSO))

### Amazon Polly

> tldr; **text-to-speech engine**, converts text into life-like speech

Does not handle translation

Standard TTS - forms speech by piecing small phonemes together

Neural TTS - more realistic but more complex

SSML - Speech Synthesis Markup Language

- Additional control over how Polly speaks
- emphasis, pronunciation, whispering, "Newscaster" speaking style

Scenarios: Read a wordpress article

Integrate with your product using API

### AWS Rekognition

> tldr; Deep learning **Image and Video Analysis**

Identify objects, people, text, activities, content moderation, face detection, face analysis, face comparison, pathing (movement of people in a video) & much more

Pay as you use

- per image or per minute (video)

Integrates with live video

- via Kinesis video streams
- e.g. Detect a person in security camera footage

Image uploaded to S3 -> S3 invokes Lambda (metadata stored in DDB) -> Rekognition identifies animals

Exam: Pick rekognition for any kind of image/video recognition

### Amazon Textract

> tldr; **Analyze text from documents**, e.g. kyc analysis 

Input can be: JPEG, PNG, PDF, TIFF

Output: Extracted text, structure and analysis

Specific language or auto-detect

Use cases: 

- Full text indexing of audio - for searching
- Meeting notes from audio
- Captions for videos
- Call analytics (characteristics, summary, categories and sentiment)

Integrates with other aps / AWS ML services

### Amazon Translate

> tldr; **Text translation** service

Translates text from a native language to other languages one word at a time

Encoder reads source -> Outputs semantic representation (meaning)

Decoder reads meaning -> writes target language

Use cases:

- Multilingual user experience
- Offer things like live chat in different languages
- Translate social media posts into native language
- Language-independence for other AWS services
- Analyze data stored in S3, RDS or other data stores

Exam scenarios: Text -> Text translation

### Amazon Forecast

> tldr; **Time-series forecasting**

Things like predicting retail demand, staffing levels, web traffic

Uses contextual information, e.g. was there a sale on? Was the weather good or bad?
