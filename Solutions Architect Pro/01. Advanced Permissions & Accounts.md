## Advanced Permissions & Accounts

> [!tldr] Advanced IAM functionality and cross-account resource sharing 
### **Security Token Service** (STS)

> STS generates temporary credentials.

It does this automatically when a principal assumes a role
- They expire after a timeout period

A role is a set of permissions needed to get a job done

**Trust policy**: wall around a role that determines who can assume it 

If you assume a role, you get the permissions policy from that role

#### What are the temporary credentials?

- Access Key
- SecretAccessKey
- Expiration
- SessionToken (must be passed)

#### What if temporary credentials are leaked?

- **You cannot invalidate existing credentials**
- They might expire hours later…
- Change the trust policy? Won’t help as it’s only used when role is assumed
- Change permissions of role? Would affect all who have role

Solution: **Revoke all existing sessions**
- This applies new inline policy to the role that DENYs all AWS resources
- Time based, depends on when role was assumed
- Technically bad actor still has access, buy they get hit with a DENY that takes precedence

#### Policy Interpretation

*Remember AWS perms start off with default deny, aka **zero permissions***

Policies are JSON documents
* Version
* Collection of statements
  * Effect (allow or deny)
  * Principal (user)
  * Action (e.g. s3:PutObject)
  * Resource (* or an arn::)
  * Condition (variables, see link below for list of them)

Groups cannot be a principal in a policy

*Explicit deny always overrides explicit allow*

If Deny and Allow overlap, we need to figure out what this overlap is and remember deny takes priority

NotAction: Matches anything not in the list provided

Certain services are global services, these include **CloudFront, IAM, Route53, Support**

Certain actions require * in Resource to function, e.g. S3.CreateBucket

S3 is a flat structure, it doesn't have folders

"Folders" are just parts of the object name e.g. /home/speak/*

Exam tip: Remember AWS perms start off with default of deny, aka zero permissions

Exam tip: Policy documents with Deny are usually accompanied with something else; deny is default so no point having it by itself

Exam tip: Look out for Not conditions, they are used to trick you in exam, make sure you understand what it means

**Variables in IAM**

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html

#### Permissions Boundaries

Used to limit permission delegation powers

E.g. Julie gives bob IAM:*

He can change his own permissions or create a new user with full admin

Boundary policy limits what the user can do

You create the policy then apply it to a user, then it affects what they can and can't do

#### Policy Evaluation Logic

Layers of stuff that ends up with effective permisions

* Explicit Deny
* Organization SCPs
* Resource Policies (e.g. on the S3 side)
  * If Allowed here, then processing stops
  * Interesting logic here
* IAM Identity Boundaries
* Session Policies (assume role, can have subset of permissions)
* Identity policies

#### Multi Account Permissions

Account A: Based on granted permissions, can the request leave the acc. perimeter?

Account B: Resource Policy, if it did, can it access the resource via a resource policy?

If no for either, DENY
#### Cross Account Permissions

Access Control Lists (ACLs) - worst
- Not recommended, Legacy
- Canonical User ID = Legacy form of account ID
	- e.g. 306031472082

Resource Policies - better
- These apply on the resource itself, e.g. S3 bucket
- There is a setting in ACLs that determines if new objects are owned by bucket owner or the account creating the object.
	- Objects owned by the uploader = potential headaches. 
	- There's a bucket setting to override this.

Cross account role - best
- Account from other account assumes rule in destination account
- Items are owned by the account that owns the role
- A lot tidier and lower admin overhead

### RAM (Resource Access Manager)

> Share resources between AWS resources, e.g. subnets or a transit gateway

Products need to support RAM then we can share them
- Owner Account creates a share
- Owner Account - has full read and write control over resource
- Principal - define who to share with

In organization accounts, there's a setting: Enable sharing with AWS Organizations, no need to invite, accept.

RAM means instead of peering VPCS we can share resources natively

We can't share the VPC itself just resources within

"Shared Services VPC" might contain a shared AD controller

**Only Owner Account can make changes to shared resources; they are read only in the other account**

Conceptually = read only objects from another account inside your account

If you create an instance in Account B using shared VPC from Account A, that EC2 instance won't be visible in Account A.

We can tag resources with our own chosen name, it's account specific
### Service Quotas

> tldr; some services have lower limits and can be extended via support request

Each service has a limit... e.g. X number of EC2 instance
- Default quotas, might be limited per account or per region
- Hard limit of 5000 IAM users in an account, this CAN'T be changed

Exam: What other hard limits are there?
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html

Service Quota Dashboard 
* To keep track of the quotas
* Also button to Request Quota increase
* See how many are in use
* Create CloudWatch alarm

Can also request increase via support ticket, service console is preferred method
- Can also interact with service quotas using AWSCLI
