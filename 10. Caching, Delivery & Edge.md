## Caching, Delivery & Edge
### CloudFront

> tldr; distances introduce latency, how can we reduce this?

Origin - Original location of content

- S3 Origin or Custom Origin

Distribution

- The 'configuration' unit of CloudFront
- Comes with a domain name, e.g. d1111abasdkhj.cloudfront.net

Edge Location

- Local cache of your data, often in cities
- 1 or more racks in a 3rd party datacentres
- 90% storage with a bit of compute

Regional Edge Cache

- Fewer of these compared to edge locations
- Another layer of caching

User -> Request to Edge location -> Cache Hit? Great, Cache Miss -> Check Regional Edge Cache? If it's there, push to Edge, return request to user and we have better performance for next user in that location

Integrates with ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager)

CloudFront is for downloads only - doesn't do any write caching
#### Behaviours

Different rules depending on paths

Pattern matched

- Default(*) - apples to everything
- Private (img/*) - might have different behaviors configured

Can customise viewer protocol

- HTTP & HTTPs, Redirect to HTTPS, HTTPS only

Field Level Encryption

Cache Directives

- Legacy
- Or newer CachePolicy and Origin request policy

TTLs can be set on behaviour basis

Can restrict viewer access based on Trusted Key Groups and Trusted Signer (legacy)

- You need signed cookies
- Or signed URLs

Compress automatically

Lambda at Edge is associated at the Behaviour level

#### Distribution Settings

Can choose to publish to all Edge locations the main ones

Default domain - Can use default cert

Custom domain - need to supply one

#### TTL and Invalidations

> tldr; how long is stuff kept at edge locations before it expires?

Say you change the image being cached - it will still get served until expiry

Or if edge location has capacity issues

Once the object expires -> Edge location checks origin, if still current -> 304 Not Modified, if it's changed 200 OK (new image updated)

We want to minimize the number of requests the Edge location is making from our origin

Default TTL = 24 hours

We can set Minimum TTL and Maximum TTL

- They don't do anything by themselves, but set an allowable range for TTLs

Headers control the actual TTL:

- Origin Header: Cache-Control max-age (seconds)
- Origin Header: Cache-Control s-maxage (seconds)
  - Both of these do the same thing
- Origin Header: Expires (Date & Time)
  - If we specify a date before or after the min/max ttl, the min/max ttl will be used

Cache invalidations

- Performed on a distribution
- Performed on all edge locations in a distribution
- A cache invalidation -> Immediately expires an object
- We can apply wildcard paths e.g. /images/whiskers*
- Useful if we need to expire the objects across the board, say if users are getting an old object
  - But there's a cost to do this
- Another approach - use versioned filenames
  - e.g. whiskers1_v1.jpg, _v2.jpg, _v3.jpg
  - Then we don't need to expire old versions

To perform an invalation
- you pick a path
- can have wildcards or be specific
- better to perform less frequent invalidations (cheaper)
#### SSL & SNI

Default distribution has a cname like https://d13132.cloudfront.net

SSL is supported by default (wildcard cert for cloudfront.net)

Exam: Unlike S3 we can put TLS around a static website

For custom domains, we need to add a cert with ACM

Regional cert needed for most services

Except global services - they are always us-east1

Cloudfront is a global service, hence the cert needs to be in us-east1

Few things we can do:
- HTTP or HTTPs
- HTTP -> HTTPs
- HTTPs only

Two SSL Connections
- Viewer -> CloudFront
- CloudFront -> Origin
- We need 2 public certs (not self-signed)
- Cloudfront is 

Historically
- One IP per SSL site
	- Historically there was no way to tell which web site you were trying to access
	- So we could only return one cert
- SNI was added in 2003 to fix this
	- Allows the site name to be returned in the TCP connection
- Now we use host-headers to distinguish multi-sites
- BUT older browsers don't support this
	- $600 per month for a dedicated IP address at each CF edge location

If we need to support older browsers, we need the dedicated IP

#### Two sides of certs

Viewer Side

We need a publicly trusted cert, e.g. Komodo, Verisign, ACM 

Exam: If created in ACM the cert needs to be in us-east1 region!

Exam: No self signed certs!

Origin Side

- S3 handles this natively - we don't need a cert
- ALB - Needs a publicly trusted cert (external or ACM)
- EC2 or on-prem - ACM doesn't support so you need another cert provider (still needs to be publicly trusted)

All certs need to match the DNS name of the CF access URL

#### Origin Types and architecture

Origin Types:
- S3
	- Designed to work with CF
	- Origin path = sub path in bucket
	- Advanced features
		- Restrict access to S3 bucket so only CF can access it
		- Old way OAI (Origin Access Identity)
		- New way: OAC (Origin Access Control)
	- Viewer Protocol policy is matched to Origin Protocol Policy (to S3)
		- e.g. HTTPS is matched on both sides
	- S3 Custom headers - Can be passed through
- Custom Origin
	- More control over ports (Custom Ports)
	- Configure Origin Protocol Policy
	- Minimum SSL protocol version

#### Caching Performance and Optimisation

Static Content
- e.g. a jpeg image, performance is better when the edge location has the jpeg and doesn't have to do an origin fetch

What about other stuff?
- Query string parameters
- Cookies
- Request headers
- CF needs to handle all these too

e.g. https://onlinestore.com/sock.jpg&color=blue&size=large

**Example: different images for colour but same image for different sizes**

Default behaviour of CF is not to pass query string parameters through
*Don't forward and don't cache*

Our query would pass through as https://onlinestore.com/sock.jpg

Which colour would it be? Would it work?

Another behaviour:
*Forward query string parameters and cache results*

But... some parameters might not actually do anything. What if there's just one size of sock in a previous image? The socksize parameter would be ineffecient.

Another behviour:
*Forward query string parameters but whitelist certain parameters*

We cache based on size not colour.

#### Security - OAI/OAC & Custom Origins

> tldr; OAI is another type of identity in AWS, associated with CloudFront distribution

When a CF distribution accesses an S3 origin, the CF distribution becomes that OAI

We can stick the OAI identify in the bucket policy to control access

Suggested approach: One OAI Identity per distribution

OAI is only for S3 origins

OAC is the new version of OAI - it supersedes OAI

What about custom origins?
- Enforce HTTPS
- Require custom headers to service requests
- Make sure all requests include this custom header

Another solution:
- Use IP ranges for CloudFront (published by AWS)
- Create a Firewall to block anything outside of the IP address ranges for CF
