## Networking Fundamentals

> [!info] Useful networking fundamentals when working with AWS

### **OSI Model**  

Host Layers – Data is chopped up and reassembled
- Layer 7 – Application
- Layer 6 – Presentation 
- Layer 5 – Session
- Layer 4 – Transport

Media Layers – How data is moved between A and B
- Layer 3 – Network
- Layer 2 – Data Link
- Layer 1 – Physical

#### Layer 1 – Physical “network cables”

A means to carry unstructured information
- Copper, Fiber, WiFi etc

Raw Bitstreams

Spec: voltage levels, timing,s rates, distances, modulation, connectors – both sides need to have a shared understanding

Hub is a L1 device – retransmits anything to all ports, including errors.

No uniquely identifiable devices

- Layer 1 = Broadcast medium, no way to directly address another device -> Fixed by Layer 2

- Layer 1 = 2 devices transmit at once, collision occurs, Layer 1 has no way of avoiding this

- Layer 1 = Can’t even detect when collisions occur!

#### **Layer 2 - Datalink Layer – “Intelligence on top of Layer 1”**  

Builds on top of L1

Ethernet is an example of L2

“Frames” – a format for sending information over L2 network

“MAC Address” – Media Access Control – 

- Unique device identifier, typically not software assigned
- MAC address should be globally unique

Frame – 

- Preamble
- Dest MAC addr
- Src MAC addr
- EtherType (which L3 protocol is putting data in)
- Payload
- Frame Check Sequence FCS (check for data loss)

CSMA/CD (Carrier-sense multiple access)

- Detects carrier on L1, avoid collisions
- Let’s say Machine is transmitting, we’ll wait until this finishes before we transmit

Encapsulation

- The data is stored in amongst other stuff, needs to be pulled out later

CD part = collision detection

- If collision is detected, back off triggered, random time then retransmit
- If still collision, back off triggered again for longer

Switch is L2 device “Hub with Superpowers”

- Has own MAC address and address table
- Has a much better understanding of network traffic
- Only forwards traffics to the port with the dest. mac address on
  - Unless not sure, sends to all ports
- Each switch port is a separate collision domain
  - Doesn’t forward collisions unlike router

Summary: Identifiable devices, Media Access Control (sharing), Collision Detection, Unicast, Broadcast

#### **Layer 3 – Network - The Internet**

Multiple L2 networks (LANs communicating) –

L2 networks might be using diff protocols, how do they talk together?

Ethernet popular, but not the only standard (PPP, MPLS, ATM)

We need a common language: IP = Internet Protocol

Routers = L3 devices

- Move packets between different networks

IPV4 and IPV6

IP Packet Structure

- Source IP
- Dest IP
- Protocol (L4 data, which network stack, TCP, UDP etc)
- Data

TTL - Maximum Hops before we give up transmitting

IP Addresses:
- 133.33.3.7
- Network Part
- Host Part
- Octets, 32bits 4x8bits
- Addresses can be Static IP or DHCP assigned

Subnet mask influences which is network part, and which is the host part
- e.g. The above is /16
- /16 just means 16 ones in binary which is 255.255.0.0
- Anything 255 is network component, 0 is host component

We can also calculate start and end of network range.
- Take 133.33.3.7
- With Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
- Network starting point is: 133.33.0.0
- Network end point is: 133.33.255.255

Devices know whether routing needs to be used by identifying where local network starts and ends.
- Default Route = Where packets with no better route go
- Routes = One hop to another until we get to destination
- Route tables = Where to next?

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): A way to find MAC addresses given a IP address
- IP -> MAC address
- Runs between L3 and L2

Limitations of Layer 3:
- No information to distinguish between applications sending traffic. E.g Email, Video stream, chat application
- Out of order delivery
- Packet gone awol, no retransmit
- No flow control
#### **Layer 4 - Transport & Layer 5 Session**

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol ) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) both run on top of IP

TCP gives reliable delivery, ordering of packets
- Uses segments, kind of like Frames or Packets
  - Sequence number allows the segment to be reformed
  - Ack
- Source port, destination port lets applications communicate
- TCP header placed inside packets
- Connection from random port (ephemeral) on client to well known port on server
- This is how we can have multiple sessions
- (We need to think about this with NACLs in AWS to accommodate two way communication over different ports)
- 3 way handshake

Session and state
- Stateless firewall = two rules, one outbound one inbound or vice versa (NACL = Stateless Firewall)
- Stateful firewall = Sees initiating traffic and response as one thing (Security group in AWS)

UDP is all about performance
### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

NAT is a process designed to handle shortage of IPv4 addresses.
- No need for NAT with IPv6.

Security benefits:
- No access to your host behind NAT from the internet.

Static NAT: 1 private to 1 fixed public address (IGW)
- Router just maps private:public and sends / receives over the internet
- At no point do internal devices have public IPs

Dynamic NAT: 1 private to 1st available public
- Similar to static but devices are not allocated a permanent ip, they get one from a pool
- Used when there aren’t enough public ip addresses for the number of private devices
- Works as long as devices aren’t accessing the same external IPs

Port Address Translation (PAT) – many private to 1 public (NATGW)
- You have one external IP but you need lots of private clients to access the internet
- src port (ephemeral assigned by client), Dest. Port, fixed
- what if randomly assigned port conflicts with another private client?
  - NAT device maintains a NAT table and assigns different port
- No way to initiate connection to private client, as there is no corresponding public ip mapping 
### **Subnetting**

>tldr; Breaking networks into smaller pieces 

**Public IP allocations**
- Class A = 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 - 16 million addresses
- Class B = 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 - 65k addresses
- Class C = 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 - 2 million address
- Class D,E also, beyond scope

**Private IP ranges**

Within the space, certain ip ranges are allocated for private networking
- Class A = 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 – 16 million, typically used inside cloud envs
- 16x Class B = 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 – 16 x 65k addresses
- 256 Class C = 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 – 256 x 256 addresses 

IPv4 vs IPv6
- ~ 4 billion ipv4 addresses available
- Basically unlimited IpV6 addresses

**CIDR ranges**

How much of the IP range is network and how much is available for hosts? 
- Entire internet is a /0 network
- Class A is a /8 network
- Class B is a /16 network
- Class C is a /24 network 
- /16 means the last 2 octets are available for hosts
- /17 is a /16 divided into 2 smaller networks
- /18 is 4 smaller networks
### **DDOS attacks**

Types:
- Application layer, e.g. botnet calling a complex php request on a website
- Protocol attack, e.g. SYN flood (tcp 3 way handshake overload)
- Volumetric, e.g. DNS amplification, exploits a protocol data imbalance 

Thing to remember: DDOS attacks can’t be stopped via usual methods, such as firewalls
- AWS has special tools to mitigate DDOS attacks
### **VLANs**

Switches have a broadcast domain
- In a typical network you might have a network for cctv, servers, client pcs, different teams
- If we separate physical networks, and connect switches, this increases broadcast domain
- What if staff member moves roles? 
	- Physical network requires recabling

VLANS solve this
- 801.1Q changes Ethernet Frame to store VLAN info
- Allows us to have multiple VLANS per domain

QinQ (second level of VLAN tagging)
- What if we use a comms provider to connect multiple networks with VLANs
- 801.1AD (QinQ) Extra VLAN S-TAG for service providers
- 1Q used in smaller networks and cloud platforms
- QinQ used for larger complex networks
#### Ports

Access Ports
- standard ethernet with no VLAN tags when communicating with hosts, but the switch adds the tag later on
- Access port needed for devices that don't handle 801.1Q and can't cope with trunk ports

Trunk ports
- connection between two 801.1Q switches, VLAN tagging is intact

Public & Private VIF and Direct Connects use VLANs 

VLANs provide: traffic isolation, between diff customers, different networks,
- Also separate broadcast domains
- 802.1Q means VLAN
- 802.1AD means nested QinQ VLANs
### **Decimal to Binary (IP Addressing)**

| **Position**        | **1**  | **2**  | **3**  | **4**  | **5**  | **6**  | **7**  | **8**  |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Binary Pos No.**  | 128   | 64    | 32    | 16    | 8     | 4     | 2     | 1     |
### **SSL & TLS**

TLS is just a newer and more secure version of SSL

Asymmetric encryption – server provides public key

Symmetrics encryption – keys are exchanged, switch to this quickly less computationally intensive

TLS can detect alterations

We have a client and a server

1. Client and server agree cipher suites, server returns certificate
2. Does client/browser trusts Certificate Authority? Also check cert is valid (not expired or revoked)
3. Client verifies server has private key
4. Switches to symmetric encryption by exchanging keys
### **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**

Routing Protocol 
- Configured automatically after peering relationship set up
- Made up of Autonomous Systems (AS)– black boxes which abstract details
- Operates over TCP port 179
- You configure a peering relationship between two AS

a.k.a. "The Routing Protocol of the Internet" 
- core networks are exchanging information about each other

BGP exchanges the best path an AS knows
- Doesn’t take into account link speed or condition, just paths
- iBGP = routing within AS
- eBGP = routing between AS

Since BGP doesn’t take into account perf or condition, how do we avoid slow links?
- ASN prepending, configuring the path length to seem longer than it actually is

BGP only advertises shortest paths
### **Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls**

Each connection has a **request**  and a **response**
- Client uses ephemeral port to well-known port on server
- Stateless firewall: we need 2 rules for a connection
- Often have to allow all ephemeral ports as we don’t know what port will be used
### **Jumbo Frames**

Bigger Payload
- Normal Ethernet MTU = 1500 bytes
- Jumbo Frame = up to 9000 bytes
- Tricky bit: making sure the network stack supports it throughout

Jumbo frames are supported within a VPC
- Inter region VPC does not support Jumbo Frames
- Same region peering does
- Traffic over VPN connections doesn't support JF
- Traffic over IG no JF
- Direct Connect does support JF
- TGW supports up to 8500
### **Layer 7 Firewalls**

Inspect data inside a HTTPs (or other) connection
- Connection terminates at the FW
- We ca identify normal / abnormal aspects of a connection
- Can look into details like headers, inspect inside metadata
- e.g. For https connection, the L7 firewall can potentially inspect inside https connection
### IPSEC VPNs

>tldr; Secure tunnels across insecure networks

Asymmetric -> Symmetric like SSL/TLS

IKE Phases:
- IKE Phase 1 – Slow and Heavy – Asymmetric
- IKE Phase 2 – Faster and agile – Symmetric

First verify identity via certs or pre shared keys
- Then public keys
- Diffie Helman key

Policy based / Route based vpn – to match interesting traffic
### **Fibre Optic Cable 101**

No notes
### **Types of cloud**

- Public Cloud = Standard AWS stuff
- Private Cloud = AWS Outposts
- Hybrid Cloud = Combination of the two
- Multi Cloud = Using AWS, GCP, Azure together
	- Not the same as Hybrid Environment – this means using cloud along side on-prem
### **RPO & RPO**  

RPO (Recovery Point Objective_
- Maximum amount of data that can be lost after recovery after unexpected failure

RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- What’s the maximum amount of time can a system be down after unexpected failure?
### **Encryption**

Envelope Encryption
- Encrypting keys with another key

KMS uses Key Encryption Keys
- Reduces amount of data sent during decryption
	- We're only encrypting the key not the actual data
- Reduces blast radius

HSM (Hardware Security Module)
- Separate from other server components
- Like the Secure Enclave on iPhone
- Hardware acceleration for encryption
#### **Hashing**

- One way - can’t derive source info from hash
- Any change results in different hash value
- Same data = same hash value
- Collisions are bad, MD5 can have collisions but only really when ‘manipulated’, SHA2-256 no collisions

**Digital Signing**

- Public/Private key architecture
- Public key widely available, can be used to encrypt stuff that’s then decrypted by private key
- Digital signing verifies integrity (what) and authenticity (who)
- First step, take hash of data
- Digital signatures allow us to trust the hash is correct because it’s been signed
- Public keys = widely distributed
