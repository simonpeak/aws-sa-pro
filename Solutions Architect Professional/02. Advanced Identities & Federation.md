## Advanced Identities & Federation

> [!info] Using external authentication providers with AWS
### SAML 2.0 Identity Federation

> tldr: Use existing AD accounts to map to AWS roles

Identity Federation is using another provider to access AWS.

Using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

**Indirect access -> You don't access AWS with the external credential, it's used to assume an existing AWS role

Used when:

- Existing Enterprise Identity Provider that is SAML compatible
- If you have an existing identity management team
- Single source of truth and over 5000 users

Federation in AWS uses IAM Roles + STS

Two way trust relationship established between e.g. AD and AWS first

SAML Assertions are trusted by AWS because of this

Mapping of AD roles to AWS roles

STSAssumeRoleWithSAML

Console access - a URL / webpage in front of this
### AWS SSO

> tldr: More advanced native version of the above.

Requires AWS Organization to be enabled

==Exam terminology: "Workplace Identity"==
==This is now the preferred way over traditional SAML 2.0==

Manage Single Sign on access

Has an identity store -> Can be an external source e.g. AD, or external SAML 2.0 provider

Identity store functionality abstracted, manual configuration reduced

Also has built in store

Handles console UI and CLI access

Single sign on, instead of separate IAM users per account

Also handles external applications, e.g. Sign in to Dropbox!?
### Cognito

Two very different features

- User pools
  - Sign in and Sign up for users
  - You sign in and get a JWT token (JSON Web token)
  - Does NOT grant access to AWS services (we need aws credentials for this)
  - Handles MFA, phone email verification etc
  - Also allow social sign-in e.g. sign in with apple
  - User Pool tokens can be used downstream, e.g. dynamodb or natively in API gateway

- Identity Pools
  - Swapping identity tokens for temporary AWS credentials
  - One possible "identity source" is a user pool JWT token
  - Swaps External Identity -> actual AWS credentials
  - Supports guest users
  - Federated Identity swap, e.g. Google, Facebook for AWS resource credentials

- Web identity federation
  - Handle many types of identity -> Swap for AWS creds
  - User pool -> Sign in -> JWT token -> Pass to Identity Pool -> Get temporary identity credentials
  - User pool can handle sign in from different providers, ends up with same JWT token

- Benefit of Cognito - handle unlimited users
  - IAM can only handle 5000 users
### Amazon Workspaces

> tldr; Desktop-as-a-service, Kind of like Citrix, RDP, but hosted inside AWS

Consistent desktop, available anywhere
- Windows and Linux

Monthly or Hourly charge model
- Hourly allows suspension when not in use but there is a fixed minimum cost

Requires a Directory Service
- Simple AD
- AD connector -> integrate with existing AD
- Managed Microsoft AD mode - native Microsoft AD

Provides System volume and User volume
- Encryption at rest supported

Workspaces actually run in AWS managed VPCs
- Most network traffic is charged as normal except connection to / from workspace over remote protocol
- Authentication and streaming gateways in the AWS VPC
- Interfaces with your VPC via ENI
- Internet access is done via NAT gateway, IGW in your VPC

Not highly available by design
- One Subnet/AZ
- There is "recovery"
- Can distribute Workspaces across several AZs to avoid all going down

Workspaces does need an AWS managed AD of some kind to work. But if we have a 2 way trust with our on-prem AD, we can log in with on-prem users.

### Managed Microsoft AD

> tldr: AWS-Managed Active Directory means full *managed* Microsoft Active Directory in AWS

Managed using standard tools

Standard 30k objects or Enterprise 500k object

HA by default
- At least 2 AZs, can be more

Supports trusts between itself and on-premise AD
- Works completely standalone, e.g. if on-prem AD fails the AWS side will still be working

Supports RADIUS-based MFA

Best choice for when:
- You are happy to have AD data in AWS
- Need more than 5000 users
- Trust relationships between AWS and on-prem AD
- Microsoft schema extensions
- RADIUS based MFA

Runs from AWS managed VPC
- Inserted into your VPC through ENI in 2+ subnets

This is the only directory service that supports one-way or two-way trust
### AD Connector

> tldr: Simple redirect, it doesn't handle directory stuff itself, it forwards to existing on-prem AD

You might use this if you don't want to stored directory data in AWS, e.g. legal reasons

Two sizes: Small and Large
- No explicit limits
- Controls the amount of compute allocated

Multiple AD Connectors can be used to spread load

Connect to at least 1 directory server

You need a VPN or Direct Connect between AWS and your own-prem
- Can be risky if this link isn't redundant / reliable

#### AWS Control Tower

> tldr; Allows quick and easy set up of multi-account environments

Orchestrates other AWS services to do the job

Kind of a beefed up Organizations feature

Management Account concept

Control Tower
- Organizations
    - OUs
    - SCPs
- Identity Centre

Creates two OUs by default

- Security OU
    - Audit
        - SNS
        - Cloudwatch
    - Log Archive
        - AWS config
        - Cloudtrail
- Sandbox
    - Test / Less rigid security

Account Factory
- Robot for creating accounts in automated way
- Template based

Landing Zone
- Concept of home region
    - e.g. Might be us-east-1 and nothing else
- Uses IAM Identity Centre
    - SSO, Federation etc
- Provides monitoring and notifitications
    - Cloudwatch
    - SNS

Guard Rails
- Drift Prevention
- Preventative
    - Mandatory, Strongly Recommended, Elective
    - Stops things from happening
- Detective
    - Compliance Checks
    - Only identifies things happening

Users can be allowed to provision accounts
- They can be given Admin rights
- E.g. Sandboxes, Client Demos
