## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity in AWS

> [!info] Recovering from disaster

### Disaster Recovery Architectures

> tldr; Different approaches with varying costs
#### Backup / Restore
- Data is backed up at primary site
- Ongoing costs: 
	- Media cost
	- No on-going spare infrastructure costs
- Restore process is lengthy, can take ages to actually get the recovered architecture up and running
- Cheap & Slow
#### Pilot Light
- Absolute minimum set of things running in a second location
- Doesn't cost a lot to run compared to main production environment
- e.g. Copy of database is being replicated but app servers are shut down
- Still quite a slow recovery time
- Fairly cheap, faster than backup/restore
#### Warm Standby
- Secondary site has a small version of the production site
- Everything is running at a smaller scale
	- When running we just need to change instance sizes, which is quicker than provisioning from scratch
- More expensive, even quick recovery
#### Active/Active
- Second site has full capacity
- Twice the resource cost, as you're paying for a second copy of the live infrastructure
- Recovery time is almost instant
- Also allows load-balancing across two sites for performance outside of a disaster
- Most expensive, but almost instant recovery
### DR Architecture - Storage

> How is storage in AWS affected by a disaster?

- Instance Store Volume: 
	- No resilience
	- Can fail with HW failure, EC2 host failure, AZ failure
- EBS: 
	- Runs within 1AZ
	- Can't handle AZ failure, doesn't support running across multi-az or region
	- However EBS snapshot can be stored in S3 which gives regional resilient
		- Except for One-Zone
- S3: 
	- Replicated across multiple AZs
	- Region failure would impact data
	- If we need multi-region, we can copy snapshot to another region
- EFS:
	- Replication across AZs
	- Can handle AZ failure with default settings
	- Region failure would impact data

### DR Architecture - Compute

> How is compute in AWS affected by a disaster?

No truly global compute services in AWS
- Some services work at a global level to redirect compute to a specific region

EC2 Host
- Runs in 1AZ
- Host maintenance or failure can impact uptime
- Host with EBS can move to another host in the same AZ
- If AZ-A fails then EBS is also impacted
	- Hence we need instances in a different AZ for high availability
- ASG can handle creating a new instance in different AZ

ECS Clusters:
- EC2 Mode
	- Similar considerations to EC2 Hosts described above
- Fargate mode
	- Serverless
	- Cluster hosts are run in a VPC that AWS hosts
	- Injected into your VPC via ENIs
	- If you've configured Services you can recover similar to ASGs

Lambda:
- Private or Public mode
- Private mode:
	- ENIs injected into VPC
	- Failure of an AZ will mean other subnets are used instead for subsequent invocations
- Public mode:
	- Lambdas operate from all AZs in a region
	- Region failure would be required to impact a service


### DR Architecture - Databases

> How are databases in AWS affected by a disaster?

Database running in EC2
- Same resilience as EC2 compute
- One way to increase resilience is to store EBS snapshot on S3 for quicker recovery
- Pretty limited, don't do it

DynamoDB
- Public Space database
- Doesn't run in VPC, or specific AZs
- Region Failure would be needed to impact DynamoDB

RDS
- Subnet group defines which subnets RDS can use in a VPC
- Standard RDS: 1 or 2 instances
- Each in different AZ, so EBS is resilient
- Can handle 1AZ loss
- If both AZs selected in subnet group are impacted, we see impact

Aurora
- Can have 1 replica per AZ
- Only limited by number of AZs in a region
- Instead of EBS we have Cluster Storage
	- Spread across all AZs in region
	- So we have storage replication by default
	- Storage can survive multiple AZ failure with correct application architecture

Global Databases
- Dynamo DB Global Tables
	- Replica tables in different regions
	- Last writer wins replication method
	- Can survive a regional failure
- Aurora Global Databases
	- Replica of Aurora cluster in a different region (read-only)
	- Secondary clusters are replicated at storage layer (within 1s)
	- Can recover even with loss of Primary region
		- Would require 2nd region to be promoted from read only
	- Note this is not multi-master replication - not active/active
- RDS: Cross Region Read Replica
	- Asynchronous replication through MySQL
	- Can fall behind
	- Places additional load on the source instance

### DR Architecture - Networking

> How is networking in AWS affected by a disaster?

VPCs are regionally resilient
- They span multiple AZs
- Subnets are tied to the AZ they are operating in
	- If a subnet fails, we lose resources in that subnet
	- ELBs help with this

Elastic Load Balancer
- Directs connections to instances in multiple subnets
- This means we can handle loss of an AZ and the subnets in it
- LB runs in one region only

Interface Endpoints
- Tied to one subnet in an AZ
- For HA we need multiple interface endpoints

Regions:
- Isolated, separate and independent
- Separate fault domains and blast radiuses

Some services are Global:
- e.g. R53 with routing policies can send traffic to any active region
- So we can deal with region loss
