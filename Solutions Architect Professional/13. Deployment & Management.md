## Deployment & Management

> [!info] Deploying infrastructure

### Service Catalog

> tldr; A specific type of IT management database, self-service style for 'end users'

Used when different teams use a service style model. E.g. one team consumes another team's services... and maybe charges for the service

Key Product Information: Product Owner, Cost Requirements, Support Information, Dependancies

Designed to enable a business to manage costs and scale

AWS Service Catalog is an implementation of this concept
- Provides a self-service portal for end users
- Admins define the product and permissions
- Create 'Products' and organise into 'Portfolios'
	- CloudFormation Templates
	- Service Catalog configuration
	- End user permissions

==Exam: Keyword: a way for end users to deploy services in a tightly managed way==

### CI/CD using AWS Code*

> tldr; CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy are services that do CI/CD
> (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)

Fundamental for collaborate development and automated builds

Usually have multiple branches
e.g. Main, Dev

Best practice is to branch off Main and work there
- Once work is finished this branch is merged into Main after being reviewed

Typical stages:
- Code
- Build
- Test
- Deploy

AWS native features can be an alternative to Github/Jenkins etc
- Advantages include integrating with other AWS services such as CloudWatch, EventBridge

![[Images/cicd_in_aws.png]]
Key files: 
- buildspec.yml (CodeBuild)
	- Influcence how the build process occurs
- appspec.yml (CodeDeploy)
	- Influence how a deployment process proceeds
- Files can also be .json
- Both files could refer to CodePipeline (which is the end-to-end tool)

More about appspec.yml: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file.html)

More about buildspec.yml: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html

#### CodeCommit

> tldr; The Github / BitBucket of AWS

Authentication:
- Done via HTTPs or SSH
- Both configured via IAM console
- Do it via your User -> Security Credentials
- SSH keypair is the better method, these can be generated from console

Authorisation:
- Can be granular with permissions via IAM
- Restrict certain IAM users to certain features or repositories

Use standard git commands to interact with repository

Some other features:
- Can check commits / branches via console UI
- Notifications
	- e.g. whenever a PR is merged
	- Can send to SNS Topic
	- Or an AWS chatbot using Slack
- Create triggers:
	- Event driven process
	- Can send to an SNS topic
	- Or... Invoke Lambda Function
		- These can be powerful and do a lot
#### CodePipeline

> tldr; Continuous delivery tool, the glue that holds everything together

Source Code -> Build Steps -> Deployments

Pipelines + Stages
- Stages have sequential or parallel actions
- Moving between stages can require approval
- Artifacts can be loaded into an action and generated from an action
	- Input Artifacts & Output Artifacts
- State changes -> EventBridge (e.g. Success, Failed, Cancelled)
	- Can do further processing via Lambda or elsewhere
- Final stage might be Deploy
	- Then CodeDeploy takes over
#### CodeBuild

> tldr; Build as a Service product, like a Jenkins server, but only pay for what you use

Simpler alternative to Jenkins for builds
- Easier to get started, not as complex as Jenkins
- Used for Builds and Tests
- Uses Docker to create consistent environments

Integrates with
- VPC
- KMS
- IAM
- CloudWatch for logs
- CloudTrail for auditing
- S3 for storage
- Events -> EventBridge for an event-driven response

Supports many languages:
- Java, Ruby, Python, Node.JS, pHP, .Net Core, Go and more

Key Components:
- Build Projects
- Build Environments
##### Buildspec.yml 
- Used to customise the build environment
- Must be located in root of source for the application you are building

Four phases
1. Install for base level install for the build environment
2. Pre-build - sign into things or install dependencies
3. Build - where application is built
4. Post_build - Package things up, push docker image, notifications

Environment variables:
- Shell variables, parameter-store, secrets manager

Artifacts
- What stuff to put where, customise artifacts and where they are stored
#### CodeDeploy

> tldr; The final piece of the puzzle, ties the rest of the Code products together
> Code Deployment As A Service product

Generally the last stage of the deployment process

Not for IaC
- Used to deploy stuff to existing infrastructure

Multiple targets:
- Can deploy to EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk or OpsWorks
- Or integrate with CloudFormation
- And can integrate with ECS or ECS Blue/Green

Deploy into other products
- Service Catalog
- Alexa Skill
- Store built version of applictaton on S3

CodeDeploy agent
- Allows integration with EC2 instances
- Or on-prem servers
##### Appspec.yml
- Files (EC2 + on-prem servers)
	- Which files from your application should be installed on instance during install
- Resources (ECS and Lambda)
	- ECS: task definition, container + port details
	- Lambda: name, alias, current version, target version
- Permissions (EC2 + on-prem servers)
	- Details any special permissions and how they should be applied to files when copied onto deployment targets
- Lifecycle Event Hooks:
	- Depends on whether you're using EC2 / on-prem, or ECS / Lambda
	- Hooks that run one or more scripts depending on target
		- ApplicationStop - prepare for application deployment
		- DownloadBundle - download file to temp location
		- BeforeInstall - pre-installation tasks
		- Install - copies application files from tmp location to final destination
		- AfterInstall - allows you to perform post install steps, config setting changes etc
		- ApplicationStart - kicks off the application, restart services stopped during *ApplicationStop* component
		- **ValidateService** - make sure service is running properly

==Exam: Remember ValidateService==
==Exam: Remember order and names of Lifecyle Event Hooks==

### Elastic Beanstalk

> tldr; Platform as a service within AWS (PaaS)

End user can focus on code, not have to worry about deploying infrastructure

You provide code, Beanstalk orchestrates the infrastructure to run this code

Keywords: Getting application up and running as quickly as possible

Uses normal AWS stuff behind the scenes
- EB spins this up using CF behind the scenes
- You can influence what infra it uses

Custom config + application code can be committed to repo

==Exam: Using Beanstalk requires app changes... not designed to be used by a non-technical end user==

#### Platforms

> tldr; Beanstalk is capable of accepting code written in many different languages

Platforms:
- Natively supported runtimes
	- Go
	- Java/SE
	- .Net Core
	- .Net Windows
	- PHP
	- Python
	- Ruby
	- Tomcat
	- Node.js
- Docker
	- Single container
		- Pull image straight into EB from repo
	- Multi container
		- Uses ECS behind the scenes to co-ordinate containers
	- Pre-configured Docker
		- Provides support to runtimes that aren't natively supported
		- Example: Java Glassfish Java 8
		- Previously: Go (now natively supported)
- Custom Platforms
	- Create these using Packer

Supported Platforms runtimes: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts.platforms.html

Key Concepts:
- Elastic Beanstalk Application
	- This isn't code
	- It's a container for everything related to an application
	- Includes code, infrastructure
- Within an Application
	- Environments
		- e.g. Prod, Test, Processing
	- You specify a tier, e.g worker tier, web tier
	- Each environment contains an ASG
		- These can be connected via SQS queues
- Deployment
	- Application Version
		- Something that belongs to an Application container
		- Also known as Source Bundles
		- Either .ZIP or .WAR files
	- Application Versions are deployed to Environments
	- Each gets a separate CNAME
	- We can test an environment, then swap CNAMEs if all works well
	- This is Blue/Green deployment
		- e.g. directing users to Prod after testing in Dev
	- Presets: Single Instance, High Availability etc
- Deployment Policies
	- All at once
		- Will cause downtime
	- Rolling - Deployment in batches
		- Loss in capacity when instances are removed
	- Rolling with additional batch
		- Extra instance(s) is added before rotating
	- Immutable
		- New temp ASG is created with updated instances
		- Once tested, they are moved to original ASG
	- Traffic Splitting
		- New temp ASG is created
		- Like immutable but we can adjust how much traffic goes to each ASG
	- Can also do manual Blue/Green deployments
		- This is just creating a second independent environment and switching over to it by updating CNAME after testing

==Exam: You need to be a developer (not end user) and you need to adjust your application to fit into Beanstalk... the pay off is no need to spin up infrastructure separately==

==Exam: Databases should generally be created outside of the Beanstalk deployment... we need it to persist through environment changes, similar reasons to EKS==

#### Elastic Beanstalk and RDS

> tldr; can create rds instance inside environment, or outside as a separate thing

Generally we only create RDS instances inside the environment for testing/development

Creating RDS outside gives us separation of Environment and Database

Process to get an RDS instance out from inside an EB Environment
- Create a snapshot of RDS
- Enable Deletion Protection
- Create new EB environment with same app version but no RDS
- Ensure new environment can connect to the DB
- Terminate old environment - EB will try to delete but we have delete protection
- Locate DELETE_FAILED, manually delete, and pick to retain stuck resources

#### Elastic Beanstalk Advanced Customisation

> tldr; you can create .ebextension files to customise infrastructure

EB is based on CloudFormation; the EB extensions are also based on CloudFormation

Inside the application source bundle:
- We create a .ebextensions folder
- Anything with YAML or JSON ending in .config is picked up
- Uses CFN format to create additional resources
- option_settings: allows you to set options of resources
- Resources allows entirely new resources

#### Elastic Beanstalk HTTPS

> tldr; need to add an SSL Cert to the loadbalancer

1. Go to EB Console -> Environment -> Load Balancer Config
2. Update Security Group configuration
	1. Allow Port 443
	2. Allow LB to connect to instance on relevant port

These can be done via .ebextensions too
#### Elastic Beanstalk Cloning

> tldr; you might want to duplicate an existing environment, e.g. prod -> test

Copies options, env variables, resources, other settings

RDS instances are cloned but **not the data**
(another reason to set up RDS externally)

Unmanaged changes are not included

Can do it from Console or CLI
- eb clone
#### Elastic Beanstalk and Docker

> tldr; single container or multicontainer

Single Container:
- Uses EC2 with Docker **NOT ECS**
- Not very efficient; one Docker container per EC2 instance
- Types of Docker deployments:
	- Dockerfile: EB will build a docker image and run it
	- Dockerrun.aws.json(version 1): Use an existing docker image, configures image ports, volumes and other config
	- Docker-compose.yml
Multi Container
- Creates an ECS cluster
	- This provisions EC2 instances and an ELB
- You need to provide a Dockerrun.aws.json (version 2) in the application source bundle (root level)
- Any images need to be stored in a container registry e.g. ECR

#### OpsWorks

tldr; An AWS managed version of Puppet and Chef

![[Images/opsworks_compared.png]]

Puppet is a config management tool
- You specify your desired state
- Puppet handles the implementation details

Chef is much more like IaC
- You define how to do things via Ruby
- Chef executes it on your behalf
- You're specifying a set of steps not a desired state

You'd only pick this service if you already use Puppet or Chef and need to bring the functionality into AWS

==Exam: Recipes, Cookbooks, Manifests refer to 3 modes of OpsWorks==

Three modes:
- Puppet Enterprise (if you need real Puppet)
	- AWS Managed Puppet Enterprise server
- Chef Automate (real Chef where you're creating servers)
	- AWS Managed Chef servers
	- Includes premium features
- OpsWorks (you want Chef but with little admin overhead)
	- AWS Implementation of Chef
	- No servers

Only use OpsWorks if you have a specific reason or need to use Puppet or Chef

#### Key Components

Stacks:
- Like CF Stacks
- Layers represent a specific function in a stack
	- e.g. a Web server layer
	- Database layer
	- Load Balancer layer
- Recipes
	- Are applied to layers
	- Do things against all instances of layers
- Cookbooks
	- Collections of recipes
- Lifecycle Events
	- Things that run on a layer
	- Setup, Configure, Deploy, Undeploy and Shutdown
		- example: Something that runs when an instance is added to the stack
		- Even on existing instances to accommodate the new instance's config
- Instances
	- 24/7
	- Time Based
	- Load Based
- Auto healing of instances
- Can incorporate existing instances (on-prem too) that were created outside the stack
- Apps
	- Store application and related files in a repository e.g. S3 Bucket
	- Contains any information needed to deploy app from repo to your instances
	- e.g. Repository URL and password

![[Images/opsworks_example.png]]

### AWS Systems Manager

> tldr; Used to be called Simple Systems Manager and often still referred to as SSM
> Public Service: Use it to view and install stuff on AWS and on-prem infrastructure

Agent based
- Needs an agent installed on the box
- Also needs an IGW or Interface Endpoint to Systems Manager endpoint
- On EC2, we need an instance role to allow SSM permissions
- For on-prem we need to create Managed Instance Activations
	- Define IAM role for on-prem instances to indirectly receive permissions
	- Also need Activation details when configuring agent on the instances
		- Activation ID
		- Activation Code

Offers quite a lot of inventory management functionality
- Collects information such as
	- Which applications are installed
	- OS version
- Patches instances
	- Baselines
- Run command
	- To run specific commands on an instance
- Desired stage
	- E.g. you want certain ports to be closed on an instance
	- Systems manager will close them if they get opened some other way
- Securely connect to EC2 instances in private VPCs
	- Instance just needs to be able to access SSM endpoint

![[Images/ssm_agent.png]]

#### Run Command

> tldr; A way of executing commands via SSM without needing SSH/RDP access

Takes a Command Document from SSM Document store and apply it to instance

Can be executed based on groupings of instances, e.g. by tag

Command Documents
- Reusable
- Contains parameters
- What steps does a command have?
- Could be simple like joining machine to domain

Rate control
- How many instances at a time?
- How many individual commands can fail before the whole command fails?

EventBridge integration
- These can trigger run commands

More info about command documents:
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-ssm-docs.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-ssm-docs.html)
#### Patch Manager

> tldr; Apply updates to instances (Windows and Linux), on-prem or AWS based

Multiple components:
- Patch Baseline
	- What should be installed?
- Patch Groups
	- Which resources should it patch on your behalf?
- Maintenance Windows
	- When should this happen
- Run Command
	- Base level command used to do the patching
- Concurrency and Error Threshold
	- How many instances, and how many errors can occur before patching stops
- Compliance
	- Did the patching work?
	- Is the right version now applied?

Names of baselines to remember for exam:
- Predefined Patch baselines
	- Linux
		- AWS-OSDefaultPatchBaseline e.g.
			- AWS-AmazonLinux2DefaultPatchBaseline
			- AWS-UbuntuDefaultPatchBaseline
	- Windows
		- AWS-DefaultPatchBaseline (Critical and Security updates)
		- AWS-WindowsPredefinedPatchBaseline-OS - Same as above
		- AWS-WindowsPredefinedPatchBaseline-OS-Applications + MS App updates

How does it work?
1. Pick a baseline
2. Create patch groups which act as containers of compute resources
3. Create a maintenance window
	1. Includes schedule
	2. Duration
	3. Target groups (the patch groups)
	4. Tasks to run (on those patch groups)
4. **AWS-RunPatchBaseline** is the actual run command used to do the patching
	1. It gets passed in the Baseline and other bits
	2. Then gets executed on the actual instances
5. Compliance step
	1. Run after the patching has finished
	2. Did the patch apply properly?
	3. Uses the inventory feature of SSM to keep track of instance state
