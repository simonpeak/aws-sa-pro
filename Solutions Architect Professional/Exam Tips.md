## Exam Tips

Assume 25% Easy, 50% Medium, 25% Hard
Assume you will run out of time

Pass 1: Go through and answer all questions you find easy
Pass 2: Go through remainder, answer mediums, if hard skip
Pass 3: Hard questions are left, work through these... if time is short you can guess

Don't guess until the end, if guessing come back to it

Use mark for review if you've guessed, a later question might trigger your memory so you can revisit later

## Question Tips

First part of question is often a preamble and doesn't really matter, can skip over

4-5 answers, multi-choice or multi-select

Associate Level: Answer is usually either right or wrong
Professional level: More 'most suitable' answers

Generally 1 answer can be excluded, e.g. doesn't make sense
Good first step is to identify this and exclude from consideration

Questions usually have a restriction, e.g. 
- Most cost effective
- Highest performance (inverse of cost effective)
- Best practice...
	- = Do what AWS recommend you do
- Time restriction

Look for amount based keyboards, e.g. what happens if **one** instance fails

Look for word fluff... if all questions start with the same words we can ignore it, it's not needed to compare the answers

Don't panic... mark for review and come back later
