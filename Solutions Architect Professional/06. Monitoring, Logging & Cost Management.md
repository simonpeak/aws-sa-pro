## Monitoring, Logging & Cost Management

> [!info] Keeping costs under control

### CloudWatch

> tldr; a service to ingest, store and manage metrics

Sits in AWS Public Zone - Can be accessed from AWS and on-prem

Make sure any services have acess to public space endpoint via IGW or Interface endpoint

EC2 provides metric data to CW without any user config required, however, this is only stuff from 'outside the instance'. You need an agent for OS metrics like memory, disk space, running processes.

==Exam: Certain things (OS level) need an agent==

Cloudwatch alarms: Notification if metrics breach criteria

Namespaces: aws ones start with aws, e.g. aws/ec2
Metric name: CPUUtilization
Dimension (name/value pair) e.g. Name: ec2-test
Resolution: 60 second granularity is standard
- You'd see 100% cpu for 60 seconds even if it was only at the time of measurement
High-resolution metrics make more sense for CPU but cost more
Retention: 
- Sub 60s retained for 3 hours, 
- 60s for 15 days, 
- 300s for 63 days
- 3600s for 455 days
When you go back in time you see less detail
Statistic: aggregation over a period (min max etc)
Percentils: e.g. p95, p97.5

Alarms: High resolution metrics can have high resolution alarms

Instance type is a dimension too, e.g. Show CPU utilization for all t3.xlarge instances
Auto Scaling Groups is another one

#### Cloudwatch Logs

> tldr; ingestion side (getting logs in), and subscription side (things that do stuff with logs)

Public service that stores, monitors and provides access to logging data

Log ingestion

AWS, on-prem IoT, or any application

CWAgent: We install this and configure it for our applications

VPC flow logs can go in here

Lots of other AWS services too (e.g. r53 dns logging, ecs container logs, elastic bs, lambda exec logs)

==Exam: Cloudwatch logs should be default answer for any Qs about logging in AWS==

Generally logs go into CWLogs in the same region

Log structure:

Log Group: (collection of log streams, might be one per resource)
- Log Stream (collection of log events)
	- Log Events
		- Timestamp
		- Raw message

An example of a log stream: Represents all log lines in /var/log/messages for one instance
3x instances = 3x log streams

Log Group generally represents the thing being monitored, e.g. /var/log/messages and contains multiple log streams

Metric filter:
- Pattern matching on events in Log Streams
	- e.g. failed SSH login attempts
- Metric filter can be used like a metric, can set alarms on it

S3 Export feature
- ==Exam: Not real time (up to 12 hours)==
- SSE-S3 only

Log Group subscriptions
- Send data to other services
- e.g. Log Group -> Subscription Filter -> Kinesis Data Firehose -> S3 Bucket
	- Kinesis Firehose is cost effective and nearly realtime (but not)
- e.g. send to Lambda -> ElasticSearch 

==Exam: Logging question -> CW Logs (both AWS and on-prem)==
==Exam: Export to S3: 12 hours==
==Exam: Near realtime or persist logs: Kinesis Data Firehose==
==Exam: Logging into ElasticSearch? Use AWS managed Lambda==
==Exam: Metric filters ==
- can be used to generate Metrics within Cloudwatch, alarms and eventual events within Eventbridge
- Use Metric filter to scan log data generate a CW metric then we can search it

### CloudTrail

> tldr; almost everything that can be done to an aws account is logged via this product

Enabled by default, only last 90 days

Logs API calls or account activities, these are called "Cloud Trail events"

For longer, or to customise service, we need to enable a **Trail**

Management Events and Data Events

Only Management Events logged by default (example is powering on an EC2 instance)

(Data events are very high volume)

Trails:
- Single Region trail
- All Region trail
		- A trail in every region but managed in one place
- Can also decide to log Global Services events
	- Some services like IAM, STS, CloudFront, always log events to us-east-1
	- Trail needs to enable this to capture these events (it's on by default via gui)
- Trail can store in S3 buckets for indefinite retention
	- Compressed JSON files
	- Flexible for ingestion in many tools
- Can also store in CloudWatch Logs
	- Searching, Filtering etc
- Organisation Trail
	- Created in management account
	- Store info for all accounts inside that org

==Exam: CloudTrail is not real time, can be up to a 15 minute delay==

Free: 90 days management events
Free: One copy of management data in S3 for each region in each AWS account

### Xray

> tldr; distributed tracing application, designed to track sessions through an application

Tracing Header: unique traceid used to track request through application
Segments: Data blocks, host ip, request, response, work done (times), issues
Subsegments: More detail
Service Graph: JSON document detailing services and resources
Service Map: Xray uses Service Graph to create a visual representation

![[Images/xray_service_map.png]]
There can be an agent:
- EC2 instances need one
- ECS agent is installed when tasks are run
- Lambda there's an option to enable
- Beanstalk it's pre-installed
- API gateway - per stage option
- Requires IAM permissions to do this stuff on our behalf

### Cost Allocation Tags

> tldr; things we can enable to provide addition info in billing reports

Per account
Or in Org master account for orgs

e.g.
aws: createdBy (which identity created a resource, provided CAT is enabled)
aws:cloudFormationStackName

User Defined:
E.g. Prod, UAT, Dev

E.g. is: app-catagram-prod or app-catagram-dev

==Exam: Can take up to 24 hours to show up==
### AWS Trusted Advisor

> tldr; check your infra against AWS best practices

Account level product: No agent needed

==Exam: Based on support plan for account==

Not free, but there's a basic version based on basic/developer support with 7 checks
- S3 bucket permissions, e.g. public buckets
- Security groups: specific ports open
- IAM use: Do you have one IAM user in an account?
- MFA on root account
- EBS public snapshots
- RDS public snapshots
- 50 service limit check (any service where you're over 80%)

115 checks on Business and Enterprise checks (check these out in AWS Trusted Advisor console)

==Exam: As part of business/enterprise you get AWS Support API: programatic access to AWS support functions, so you can initiate checks when ever required==

CloudWatch integration -> Take action based on failing check
