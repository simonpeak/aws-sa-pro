> tldr; IaC tool native to AWS

Template based
* JSON or YAML

You focus on the WHAT, CF deals with the HOW

A **portable** template should be re-usable

Template structure:
* AWSTemplateFormatVersion
* Description
* Metadata
	* Used to affect template appears in ConsoleUI
* Parameters
	* Default values
	* Which AZs are used
	* List of things that can be selected in drop-downs
	* Can be AWS supplied SSM parameters, e.g. look up latest AMI ID
* Mappings
	* Lookup tables
* Conditions
	* Decision making in the template
	* E.g. If env = Prod, then CreateProdResources = True
* Transform
* **Resources** <--- only mandatory section
* Outputs
	* One the template is finished, output relevant ids

SSM Public Parameters
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-public-parameters.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-public-parameters.html)

Exam: If we have a Description it needs to immediately follow  AWSTemplateFormatVersion

Template -> CloudFormation -> Stack
- A stack is a physical representation of a template
- CF's job is to keep logical and physical in sync

### Portable vs non-portable templates

Portable templates can be applied multiple times and in different regions
- generate S3 bucket name per run by removing explicit name
	- if no name is supplied cf generates a unique one based on stack name and randomness
- doesn't use hardcoded regional specific ids e.g. AMI IDs

### Parameters

Template and Pseudo Parameters
- defaults
- allowedvalues
- min and max length
- allowed patterns
- noecho
- type

These can be changed in ConsoleUI

Pseudo parameters: not defined in parameters section but can be referenced in the stack
- AWS::Region
- AWS::StackName
- AWS::AccountID
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html)

### Intrinsic Functions

> tldr; Gain access to data at runtime, think data blocks in TF

- !Ref 
	- return parameter value
	- or return physical id from logical resource
- FN::GetAtt
	- retrieve any attribute associated with the resource
	- e.g. publicIP
- Fn::Split & Fn::Join
	- Split: Turns a single string into a list
	- Join: List into single string
- Fn::GetAZs & FN::Select
	- List all AZs then work through them at index 0
- Conditions (FN::IF, And, Equals, Not & Or)
- Fn::Base64 & Fn::Sub
	- Used for userdata
	- We supply plain text script in template and function will convert it to Base64
	- Sub allows variables in the userdata
- Fn::Cidr
	- Makes creating VPCs easier
	- Calculates subnets from a CidrRange
	- Gives us a list then we can iterate through with Fn::Select

### Mappings

> tldr; maps keys to values

e.g. List of AMIs by region and architecture

They help improve template portability

Mappings:
  RegionMap:
    us-east-1:
      HVM64: "ami-0dasd0c09asjd"
      HVMG2: "ami-09fff00909ddd"

!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey]
!FindInMap [ "RegionMap", !Ref "AWS::Region", "HVM64"]

### Outputs

> tldr; stuff that's useful post configuration can be outputted

Often used in nested stacks

Outputs:
  WordpressURL:
    Description: "Instance Web URL"
    Value: !Join [ '', [ 'https://', !GetAtt Instance.DNSName]]

### Conditions

> tldr; allows a stack to react to certain conditions and change infrastructure

Evaluated before even considering the resources

Parameters:
  EnvType:
    Default: "Dev"
    Type: String
    AllowedValues:
      - 'dev'
      - 'prod'

Conditions:
  IsProd: !Equals
    - !ref EnvType
    - 'prod'

Resources:
  Wordpress:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Condition: IsProd

### DependsOn

> > tldr; establish key dependences within resources, cf creates stuff in parallel, but sometimes we need a before b

CF has implicit dependencies

E.g. IGW attachment references VPC and IGW, so CF knows it has to wait until after those two are created to proceed

But what about an ElasticIP? Can be created any time. But we really want to tie it to an IGW using DependsOn

Exam: EIPs are a common use of DependsOn in exam

### Wait Condition and Signals

> tldr; helper script, sometimes CF doesn't know if things are really complete, e.g. EC2 instance is 'done' but that's all we know

We trigger a wait Timeout H:M:S up to 12 hours

CreationPolicy
- Used for EC2 instances or AutoScaling Groups
- Indicate we want X success results from signal
- CFN signal is a helper script that runs as part of userdata
- we can use cfn-signal to wait for X number of success signals
- cfn-signal actualy runs on the ec2 instance so has more insight

If timeout expires before we receive the signals, return FAIL

WaitCondition
- Separate resource in a template
- A progress gate within a template
- Stops things from proceeding until success
- Can depend on other resources
- Allows data to be passed back, e.g. output of small licensing file

WaitHandle
- Presigned URL that is hit with the signals
- This can then be accessed by the helper script to return signal result

CreationPolicies simpler to manage, but WaitConditions more flexible

### Nested Stacks

> tldr Many stacks are isolated, everything in the stack shares a lifecycle

However there's a limit of 500 resources per stack
Stacks are isolated
- No ability to reference resources in other stacks

Two ways to architect a multi-stack architecture:
- Nested stacks
- Cross stack references

Root Stack
- Parent Stack
	- Nested Stack

CF stack is a resource AWS::CloudFormation::Stack in a parent template

Outputs from nested stack are returned to parent stack

DependsOn can reference other stacks

Breaking up a template into nested stack enables re-use, e.g. VPCstack might be used for multiple things
- Remember each time we use it it'll create a new VPC

Use Nested Stacks when:
- You need more than 500 resources
- You are modularising your templates
- You want to make the installation process easier, you can apply a single root stack which then applies all the nested stacks
- Use only when everything is lifecycle linked

### Cross Stack References

> tldr alternative to nested stacks, use if you need to reference resources outside the current stack

Scenario: Shared VPC
- The VPC has a long lifecycle
- But the stuff in it might be short

By design CF stacks are isolated.

To do this we **export outputs**: this makes them visible in other stacks

We then use Fn::ImportValue function instead of Fn:REF

Exports are Per Region, Per Account
- Cross region/cross account is not supported

Exam: Remember a template and a stack are different
Nested Stack = reuse template
Cross Stack reference = reference existing stack

### StackSets

> tldr multi-account deployments, deploy a stack in multiple accounts from a central one

StackSets are containers
They contain StackInstances

StackSets
	StackInstance 1 
		Region 1
			Account 1
				Stack
	StackInstance 2
		Region 2
			Account 1
				Stack

StackSets are applied in an admin account
- StackInstances are containers for individual stacks in an account
- They record what happened with stacks in the other accounts

Self Managed or Service Managed (AWS Organizations)

Terms: 
Concurrent Accounts
- How many accounts can be deployed in one go
Failure Tolerance
- How many accounts in the set can fail before the process is considered failed
Retain Stacks
- When you remove a stack instance, are resources deleted or kept?

Use Cases:
- Enable AWS Config
- AWS Config rules across multiple accounts
- Create IAM roles for cross account access

### Deletion Policies

> tldr Can be defined per resource in a stack; do we delete physical resources when we delete the corresponding logical resource?

Other options:
- Delete (default)
- Retain
- Snapshot
	- Works with EBS Vol, ElastiCache, RDS, Redshift Neptune

Delete policy only applies to delete style operations
- Doesn't cover delete/recreate based on  changes to resource definitions

### Stack Roles

> tldr permissions needed to manage stacks and resources in an account

Often a problem
- Role separation needed between managing CF and resources

E.g. we don't want Phil to actually be able to create resources manually as a result of giving him CF perms

To achieve this:
- We make use of PassRole
- We create a role that can do the infra provisioning
- Phil has permissions to create/update/delete stacks
- Role is attached to stack when it runs
	- Now the role can manage resources using the role instead of Phil's account

### CFN Init

> tldr; simple configuration management system, alternative to userdata

Resources:
- AWS::CloudFormation::Init
- Desired state like Ansible rather than how (userdata)

Uses cfn-init helper script, called via userdata bootstrap
- Like userdata, only runs once

Config Sets is where the exact tasks are described
### CFN Signal

> tldr; cfn-init does the config, cfn-signal lets CF know it's done

CF has no idea about whether user data has run successfully - will report create complete even if script is still running
- Use cfn-signal and CreationPolicy ResourceSignal
### CFN Hup

> tldr; tool we can install on ec2 instance; looks for changes to stack, gives us a way to re-run cfn init

### Change Sets

> tldr; when changes are made to CF stacks, we might see impact; change sets let us see this ahead of time

We use change sets to see what the affect will be

Like terraform plan

We can try many different change sets, and discard the once that didn't do what we wanted

### Custom Resources

> tldr; lets us use cloud formation for things it doesn't natively support

E.g. Populate an S3 bucket with objects when you create it
E.g. Or delete objects from an S3 bucket so CF can destroy it

Process:
- CF begins process of creating an object
- Sends event data to lambda or SNS topic to do stuff
	- E.g. copying images to S3 bucket
- CF tracks dependencies
	- When Delete Stack is run, it will trigger custom resource again
		- Delete function will clean the objects up
- Avoids stack deletion issues caused by objects in bucket
